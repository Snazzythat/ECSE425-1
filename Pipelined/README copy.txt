Run the processor
Instructions:
1- Run "python assembler.py" in command line
2- input assembly file name
3- Create a new project in ModelSim and add all .vhd files as exisiting files
4- Compile all files and start simulation on the "Sandbox.vhd"


Optimisation were implemented but not integrated to the processor because of time issue
Bellow are the instructions you need to follow to run each optimizatiion technique testbanch

Run the Branch Predictor
Instructions
Create a new project in ModelSim and add .vhd files that the branch-predictor folder contains i.e.
	1. tb_branch_predictor.vhdl
	2. branchPredictor.vhdl

Compile all files and start simulation on the “tb_branch_perdictor.vhdl”
